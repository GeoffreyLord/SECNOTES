# Trivy Notes
## Overview
Trivy is an open-source security scanner designed to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in container images, Kubernetes clusters, file systems, and infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations. Trivy integrates seamlessly into DevSecOps workflows and is widely used in containerized environments to ensure secure deployments by scanning for known vulnerabilities in operating systems, application dependencies, and configuration files.

Trivy is part of the Aqua Security project and is highly efficient at scanning for security issues in various environments, making it an essential tool for developers, security engineers, and DevOps teams.

## Key Features of Trivy
1. Container Image Scanning
    - Description: Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities by inspecting both operating system packages and application dependencies. It checks for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) against multiple vulnerability databases.
    - Usage:
        - Run Trivy against a Docker or OCI-compliant image to detect vulnerabilities in both the base image and any installed libraries or software.
        - Example Command:

                trivy image <image_name>
    - Key Benefits:
        - Identifies vulnerabilities in container images before they are deployed.
        - Scans for CVEs across multiple databases (e.g., NVD, Red Hat, Alpine, Debian).
2. Kubernetes Cluster Scanning
    - Description: Trivy can scan Kubernetes clusters for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in running workloads, configurations, and secrets.
    - Usage:
        - Scan a running Kubernetes cluster using the trivy k8s command to detect security issues in resources like pods, services, and secrets.
        - Example Command:

                trivy k8s --report summary
    - Key Benefits:
        - Detects misconfigurations and security issues in Kubernetes deployments and resource definitions.
        - Ensures Kubernetes clusters follow security best practices.
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning
    - Description: Trivy scans infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files such as Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Kubernetes manifests for security misconfigurations.
    - Usage:
        - Scan IaC configuration files to ensure secure configurations before deploying infrastructure.
        - Example Command:

                trivy config /path/to/terraform/directory
    - Key Benefits:
        - Identifies insecure configurations in IaC files before they are applied, ensuring a secure infrastructure from the start.
        - Supports multiple IaC formats, including Terraform, Kubernetes YAML files, and more.
4. File System Scanning
    - Description: Trivy can scan local file systems for vulnerabilities in installed packages, binaries, and configuration files.
    - Usage:
        - Scan a local file system for vulnerabilities to ensure all installed packages are secure.
        - Example Command:

                trivy fs /path/to/directory
    - Key Benefits:
        - Detects vulnerabilities and configuration issues in local file systems, ensuring the underlying environment is secure.
5. Application Dependency Scanning
    - Description: Trivy scans for vulnerabilities in application dependencies by checking against the known vulnerability databases for package managers like ```npm```, ```pip```, ```bundler```, ```composer```, and more.
    - Usage:
        - Scan the dependencies listed in your application’s package files (e.g., ```package.json```, ```requirements.txt```) for known vulnerabilities.
        - Example Command:

                trivy fs --severity HIGH,CRITICAL /path/to/project
    - Key Benefits:
        - Ensures that application libraries and frameworks are secure and up-to-date by scanning dependency files for known vulnerabilities.
6. Built-in Reporting
    - Description: Trivy generates detailed reports of its findings, including the severity level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) and the CVE details for each vulnerability.
    - Usage:
        - You can customize reports by filtering vulnerabilities based on severity or by exporting the results to different formats (e.g., JSON, table, or SARIF).
        - Example Command:

                trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --format json -o result.json <image_name>
    - Key Benefits:
        - Easy-to-read reports help prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, making it easier for teams to address critical issues first.

## Common Use Cases
1. Scanning Docker Images Before Deployment
    - Container Image Scanning: Trivy is often used to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to a container registry or deploying them in production.
    - Example:

            trivy image myapp:latest
2. Securing Kubernetes Clusters
    - Kubernetes Scanning: Trivy can scan a Kubernetes cluster to identify misconfigurations and security issues in running workloads, ensuring the cluster adheres to security best practices.
    - Example:

            trivy k8s cluster
3. Ensuring Secure IaC Deployments
    - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning: Trivy is used to scan Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, or other IaC files to detect misconfigurations before deploying cloud or on-prem infrastructure.
    - Example:

            trivy config /path/to/terraform/files
4. Validating Application Dependencies
    - Application Dependency Scanning: Trivy ensures that application dependencies are free from vulnerabilities by scanning package manager files like ```requirements.txt``` (Python) or ```package.json``` (Node.js).
    - Example:

            trivy fs --severity HIGH /path/to/project
5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Integration
    - CI/CD Integration: Trivy can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan images, dependencies, or configurations for vulnerabilities before deploying to production.
    - Example: Adding a Trivy scan to a Jenkins pipeline for every build to ensure the application is secure.

## Vulnerabilities and Issues Detected by Trivy
1. Operating System Vulnerabilities
    - Description: Trivy detects vulnerabilities in packages installed in container images, such as operating system-level libraries and dependencies.
    - Example: Trivy scans for CVEs in base images like Ubuntu, Alpine, or Debian.
2. Application Dependency Vulnerabilities
    - Description: Trivy scans for known vulnerabilities in application dependencies, such as those managed by ```npm```, ```pip```, ```gem```, ```bundler```, or ```composer```.
    - Example: Detecting a critical vulnerability in a dependency defined in ```package.json```.
3. Kubernetes Misconfigurations
    - Description: Trivy detects insecure configurations in Kubernetes manifests or running resources, such as overly permissive pod security policies or missing security contexts.
    - Example: Finding a misconfigured Kubernetes pod with privileged access.
4. Infrastructure Misconfigurations
    - Description: Trivy scans IaC files like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to detect insecure configurations, such as public-facing resources or weak security group rules.
    - Example: Identifying open SSH ports in a security group defined in Terraform files.
5. Sensitive Data Exposure
    - Description: Trivy scans file systems and container images for hardcoded secrets such as API keys, passwords, or tokens.
